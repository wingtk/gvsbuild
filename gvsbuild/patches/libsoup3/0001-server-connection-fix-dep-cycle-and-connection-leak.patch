Subject: [PATCH] server-connection: fix dep cycle and connection leak

The initial message contains a cycle-reference to the connection. We
need to decrement the reference in order to properly clean up the
connection.

Before this patch, it was possible SoupServerConnection-finalize was
never called. This was causing a memory leak (and socket FD leak).
